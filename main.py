"""Brandon Mathews - "Python To-Do List" """
"""This is a todo list with various commands that can be used with the name of task on same line. This was me
working with tweaking inputs to allow for single line inputs, stripping the response and having the program operate
differently depending on key words. The main features is to show, create, edit, delete and complete tasks on a to-do list
or planner. All completed tasks are then saved to a new text file for future reference. This can be a useful tool 
when you are doing project managing as the quick and efficient manner to update and adjust will come in handy."""
